This Jupyter Notebook (youai.ipynb) is a Python script for automating the creation of educational or explanatory videos. It uses APIs (Groq for script generation, OpenAI's DALL-E for image creation, Hugging Face for additional image generation, and gTTS for text-to-speech) to:

Generate detailed video scripts based on user input.
Create images for each script section.
Produce voiceover audio from the script text.
Compile images and audio into a video using MoviePy.
The notebook includes multiple cells with iterations of code for script parsing, media generation, and video editing, focusing on topics like volcanoes, AI applications, and natural wonders. It's designed for content creation workflows but requires API setup and careful handling of credentials.
